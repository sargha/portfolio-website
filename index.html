		<div>Inspired by many breadboard videocard builds online and especially Ben Eater’s on YouTube I went on a journey to try and recreate the VGA build he has done. But to me that felt way too boring, recreating something that had already been done. I wanted to take it an extra step further. Instead of building a low resolution video card that outputs at less than 640p, I set of on a journey to build a video card that would output using HDMI at 1920x1080p instead. This turned out to be harder than I thought it would be. Changes to Generic Video Card Project      1. HDMI output instead of VGA      2. Higher output resolution of 1920 x 1080 (1080p)      3. Ability to playback full videos and not only display a static pitcture
Troubles/Blocks and Questions with Project       1. HDMI uses a digital signal instead of an analog signal, how would I deal with that on TTL chips?      2. 1080p has a higher pixel frequency of 148.5Mhz compared to that of 640p at 40.00Mhz      3. How would I deal with that many bits of data?       4. I started with 4 Bit counters, how will I scale this up? 

With all of these questions to answer I set out to build my Breadboard Video Card. Get ready this is going to be fun.</div>

</div>
		<div>Michigan Tickets App
</div>
		<div>iOS App for students to buy and sell tickets safely
</div>
		<div>The first version design was simply a test to find the balance of correct colors to use for the app, as well as to design the simplest user interface for this app. However as time went on with my design things got a bit more complicated. I began to draw inspiration from the design of the Venmo app and thus resulted in a version two design much like that. Working with Adobe XD, I was able to create an iPhone mockup for version 2 of my design.</div>
		<div>This iOS App like many of my projects is still a work in progress. I have the mindset that even the best designs and the best projects can always be made better when looked at from a different perspective. 

At the University of Michigan, especially during our football season, many students rely on a Facebook 
group to buy and sell their student tickets. 

Problems this App Solves:
      1. Getting scammed by sellers who are not University of Michigan Students      2. Not getting paid the correct amount by a buyer      3. Not getting the ticket, thus losing money      4. Having to text multiple people in order to find a ticket in your price range      5. Not knowing what a good price to sell your ticket at 
How the App Solves Issues:      1. Verifies that seller is a University of Michigan student via UM Email      2. Money is not sent to seller, until both seller and buyer confirm transfer of ticket      3. One place to see all available tickets available for sale       4. Estimated pricing option for sellers based on the time the ticket is posted

		<div>Main Riff (Where Are We Gonna Go From Here)</div>
		<div>Writing and directing movie Dear Viewer
</div>
		<div>What pushes a person to take action?
 Why do we make the decisions that we do? 
Take that risk, find that passion, lead a movement.

In our daily lives we often tend to move quickly, swiping through our Instagram and Facebook feeds continuously. In an age where everyone is connected why not take a moment to disconnect. Live in the moment. Take a stroll. Play on the sidewalk once again. 

In Dear Viewer we follow a character in their day to day lives, where time is of the essence and every second is a moment spent making memories, not posting to stories. 

See what happens when time is warped and every end is a new beginning. 


Final goal for this movie is to submit it to the Ann Arbor film festival. I am lucky to have friends on many different fields, such as music and film to help me alongside this journey. 


Take a listen to the introductory music to the movie below (contendor):

		<div>1. The evolution of the political compass (and why libertarianism is not right-wing)

2. Measuring Proximity Between Newspapers and Political Parties: The Sentiment Political Compass

3. Truth of Varying Shades: Analyzing Language in Fake News and Political Fact-Checking

4. The Social Impact of Natural Language Processing</div>
		<div>Language processing application to determine a person’s political following based on social media posts
</div>
		<div>Every morning I wake up to an onslaught of notifications, and usually always the first I see are from a newsource updating me on the days Political Current events. I never really understood how to successfully bring up these daily political events in a conversation. This gave me an idea. 

What if by analyzing a person’s social media posts and messages I could place them on a political compass? 

This project is also a work in progress. I am currently in the research phase.  

By using natural language processing and creating an algorithm to determine the weight of a word on a political spectrum I am developing this application.
